            Apple's iPhone 5c isn't the low-cost phone you've been
            waiting for
        </h3>

        <b>The iPhone 5c</b>, simply put, is for those who've grown numb to Apple's largely evolutionary
        takes on its primary iPhone range. It'll attract a younger audience that cares less about finely
        beveled edges and more about playing <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/09/10/iphone-5s-and-5c-cases/"><i>Connect 4 on their iPhone case</i></a>.
        It'll cater to the same <font color="green"> <i>crowd that has looked</i> </font> longingly towards the $599 (again, off-contract) <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/08/05/motorola-moto-x-review/">Moto X</a> -- a phone for the
        mainstream, and a phone that's as colorful as one's soul. In a way, this is the anti-Moto X. From a
        price, spec and feature perspective, it's a match that's too close to call. The iPhone 5c's camera
        <font color="red">has</font> an edge on the <font color="red">Moto X</font>, but the <i>X's Active Display</i> is a boon for notifications. As these things
        tend to go, a lot of it boils down to ecosystem preference. The iPhone 5c is being built for the
        same audience as the <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/09/07/ipod-nano-review-2010/">flashy iPod nano</a>, and moreover, Apple built it for those on <u>Wall Street</u>
        who feel that it simply must attract new markets to stay atop its game.

        Apple never showed intentions of racing the <b><u>Nexus 7</u></b> to the bottom in the tablet game, and the 
        <b><i>iPhone 5c</i></b> is proof that it won't do that in the phone arena, either. <br>
